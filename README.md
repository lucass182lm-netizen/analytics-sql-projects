# Analytics SQL Projects

This repository contains SQL projects focused on analytical data modeling, business logic centralization and creation of shared analytical foundations for multiple teams.

The projects presented here demonstrate how SQL can be used not only for querying data, but for building scalable, reusable and governance-oriented analytical layers.

## Project: Unified Operational Analytics

### Overview
This project provides a **unified operational analytics base** that consolidates CRM, billing and payment data into a single monthly analytical dataset.

It was designed to serve as a **single source of truth** shared across Customer Experience (CX), Customer Success (CS) and Backoffice teams.

### Business Context
Prior to this consolidation, each operational area relied on separate data views and calculations, leading to duplicated logic and inconsistent metrics.

This project established a unified analytical foundation, enabling different teams to work from the same dataset while maintaining consistent definitions and metrics.

### Objective
- Unify multiple operational data sources into a single dataset
- Centralize business rules at the data layer
- Provide a reusable analytical base for multiple teams
- Reduce metric inconsistencies across BI tools

### Data Granularity
- Consumer Unit + Month  
- One record per unit per reference month

### Key Techniques Used
- Layered SQL modeling using CTEs
- Window functions for monthly deduplication
- Temporal alignment using `DATE_TRUNC`
- Business rule implementation with `CASE` logic
- Surrogate keys generated via hashing

### Analytics Consumption
The unified dataset is designed to be consumed by **multiple BI and reporting tools**.

By centralizing logic and definitions at the data layer, this project enables:
- Consistent metrics across dashboards
- Reuse of the same dataset by different teams
- Reduced duplication of logic in BI tools
- Faster development of analytical reports

CX, CS and Backoffice teams operate on a shared analytical foundation, regardless of the visualization layer.

## Project: Monthly Churn Analytics

### Overview
This project builds a **monthly churn analytics dataset** based on CRM lifecycle dates, including contract start and cancellation information.

It provides a standardized churn definition used consistently across operational and executive reporting.

### Objective
- Create a reliable monthly churn dataset
- Define churn using contract lifecycle logic
- Enable churn analysis by multiple dimensions
- Support both operational and executive decision-making

### Data Granularity
- Account + Month  
- One record per account per reference month

### Key Techniques Used
- Date spine to ensure complete monthly coverage
- Window functions for account-level deduplication
- Monthly churn rate calculation
- Year-to-date (YTD) churn aggregation
- Dimensional slicing by cancellation attributes

### Executive and BI Consumption
This churn dataset is designed to be consumed by **multiple BI and reporting tools**, serving both operational and executive-level analytics.

It is primarily used to monitor **churn-related OKRs and strategic performance indicators**, supporting management and leadership teams with a consistent and reliable view of customer retention.

By centralizing churn definitions and calculations at the data layer, the project ensures:
- Consistent churn metrics across dashboards
- Alignment between operational teams and leadership
- Reliable inputs for OKR tracking and executive reporting
- Reduced risk of metric discrepancies across BI tools

## Project: Billing Onboarding Analytics

### Overview
This project focuses on monitoring the **billing onboarding process** for newly activated customers.

It consolidates CRM, contract and billing data to provide visibility into whether billing has been successfully initiated after customer activation.

### Objective
- Track billing onboarding status for new customers
- Identify units that have not yet started billing
- Provide operational visibility into early billing lifecycle
- Support CX, CS and Backoffice teams during onboarding

### Data Granularity
- Consumer Unit (anonymized) + latest billing status

### Key Techniques Used
- Early filtering for performance optimization
- Window functions to retrieve the latest billing status
- Business logic to classify onboarding stages
- SQL-based operational monitoring design

### Analytics Consumption
The dataset generated by this project is consumed by **multiple BI and reporting tools**.

It supports operational follow-up and management-level visibility, helping teams ensure that billing onboarding is completed correctly and on time.

## 🇧🇷 Resumo em Português

Este repositório reúne projetos SQL voltados à modelagem analítica e à centralização de regras de negócio na camada de dados.

Os projetos apresentados cobrem diferentes etapas do ciclo de vida do cliente, desde o onboarding até métricas estratégicas de retenção.

### Base Analítica Operacional Unificada
O projeto **Unified Operational Analytics** cria uma base analítica mensal unificada utilizada por CX, CS e Backoffice como fonte única da verdade.

A solução centraliza regras de negócio, padroniza métricas e permite que múltiplas ferramentas de BI utilizem a mesma base, reduzindo inconsistências e retrabalho.

### Churn Mensal
O projeto **Monthly Churn Analytics** cria uma base mensal de churn com base no ciclo de vida dos contratos no CRM.

Essa base é utilizada tanto para análises operacionais quanto para acompanhamento de **OKRs e indicadores estratégicos**, oferecendo à gerência e à diretoria uma visão consistente sobre retenção de clientes.

### Onboarding de Faturamento
O projeto **Billing Onboarding Analytics** monitora o processo de onboarding de faturamento de novos clientes.

A base oferece visibilidade operacional sobre o início do faturamento após a ativação, apoiando CX, CS e Backoffice no acompanhamento inicial e ajudando a garantir que o faturamento seja iniciado corretamente.

Todos os projetos foram desenhados para suportar múltiplas ferramentas de BI, mantendo governança, consistência e escalabilidade analítica.
